This is _the makerlog_. This is an internet weblog. If something is related to open source software, or technology that supports civic engagement, community organizing, and the mad science of citizens, it's on _the makerlog_. Maybe.

And maybe not. There's no money or huge team behind _the makerlog_. Right now we're on a small adventure, bouncing about in the interwebs.

You'll find news about physical computing, civic technology, JavaScript, links to interesting related things, etc. in _the makerlog_.
