This is the _makerlog_. This is an internet weblog. If something is related to open source software, or technology that supports civic engagement, community organizing, or the mad science of citizens, it's on the _makerlog_. Maybe.

And maybe not. There's no money or huge team behind _the makerlog_. Right now we're on a small adventure, bouncing about in the interwebs.

What do we include in this publication? Code, art, robots, & the people behind those things.

## topics we'll cover:
- art 
- code
- diversity
- music
- games
- robotics
- mapping
- civics & governance
- the people behind the projects
